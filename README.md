# The Python's Nest
No, no, this is not a Python module or a video game. <br>
This is simply a compilation of some of the many, many small programming projects I created since the year of 2018.

## Projects ##
- <a href="https://github.com/joshuainovero/the-pythons-nest/tree/Computed-Tomography">Computed Tomography</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/joshuainovero/the-pythons-nest/tree/Temperature-Distribution">Temperature Distribution</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/joshuainovero/the-pythons-nest/tree/Web-Replicas-in-HTML-and-CSS">Web Replicas using HTML and CSS</a>
## What projects can be found here?
I include in this repository a variety of light Python programs which I might have used one way or another out of my own interests or for learning something. <br>
These programs include:
* Algorithms in performing statistical analysis procedures
* Webpage Scraper which extracts data from a large table
* A Computed Tomography Simulator 

Occasionally, I also add in files using other languages, especially in HTML and CSS, that may be worth keeping in this directory.

## Which modules do you use in your Python programs?
```python
import math
  # How would I perform sines, cosines, complex numbers, floors and ceilings without this important module?
 
import random
  # Simple randomizing functionality which is useful in Monte Carlo Simulations.
  
import numpy
  # This module, particularly the array class, is utilized in some of my mathematics-heavy programs.
  # Performs data manipulation and operations involving matrices and vectors.
  
import PIL
  # Provides useful tools for manipulating existing images and generating new images from arrays of numbers.

import pandas, requests, lxml.html
  # Pandas handles large dataframes with a focus on presenting the data other than just computing with it.
  # The latter two allow for data scraping from a website, which results in a large amount of data for Pandas.
  
import matplotlib
  # A great library that makes plotting data (with matplotlib.pyplot) simple to execute.
  
import scipy
  # Offers advanced statistical methods, such as probability distributions, in scipy.stats.
  
import pygame
  # Used this before to create a simple bullet hell game, but it was prone to lag and became cluttery to code.

import perfplot
  # Useful when comparing the runtimes of selected functions or algorithms.
  
import PyQt5
  # A good GUI builder for Python that might get unwieldy for me due to clutteriness and complexity.
  
```
