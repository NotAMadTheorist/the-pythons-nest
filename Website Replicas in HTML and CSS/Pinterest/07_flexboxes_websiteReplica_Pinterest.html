    Current Issues with this Replica:
        a. No buttons when hovering over an image
            - cannot be done with relative positions since this causes the gallery to be in
             front of the navigation bar 

        b. Hovering always causes the image to be in front of the navigation bar
            - cannot be removed with HTML and CSS alone
            - requires Javascript


    Flexboxes function similarly to grids by the fact that they both contain items in a certain 
    order, but it has two major differences to the latter:
        1. The boundaries of the items in flexboxes are not defined by any horizontal or vertical line.
        2. Flexboxes focus on one-dimensional ordering that may be wrapped into a disordered 
         two-dimensional layout.

    CSS provides five different kinds of positioning to further fine tune less conventional layouts:
        1. Static - everything else follows this format
        2. Relative - positions the element relative to its original position
        3. Absolute - positions an element relative to a parent element with a "Relative" position
        4. Fixed - positions an element relative to the part of the screen or viewport and causes it
                  to not move while scrolling, and
        5. Sticky - acts like "Relative" when on-screen but becomes "Fixed" on one side of the screen
                   when scrolled from view.
    
    Fixed positioning can be used to create navigation bars that don't move when the page is scrolled
    and to display warnings and other announcements in front of the static page.
